        You are provided with two images representing the same floorplan:
        1. **Original Floorplan Image** : A clean architectural drawing.
        2. **Segmented Floorplan Image** : Displays the same layout with labeled wall names and index annotations placed at the approximate center of each wall.

        Additionally, you are given:
        - **`{walls_coord}`** and  **`{openings_coord}`** : floorplan metadata information which includes A list of wall names and their corresponding coordinates.A list of opening coordinates (not yet labeled as doors or windows).
        
        
        floorplan:
        The metadata information and image 2 are basically correct, and you don't need to make major changes to the current layout, such as moving a point too long. You only need to make small changes to walls and openings where necessary, according to the float rules:
        1. Use Image 1 (original floorplan) as the baseline reference. Image 2 is mostly correct â€” only refine walls and openings where necessary.
        2. Remove noise or structural errors, including:
            - Short isolated walls whose endpoints do not connect to any other wall and are far from other walls.    
        3. Ensure wall connectivity by adjusting coordinates:
            - Extend or trim walls along their original direction to restore intersections observed in Image 1.
            - If a wall is isolated (i.e., disconnected at both endpoints) but is very close to another wall, snap its endpoints to the nearest neighboring wall without changing its orientation (only adjust length, not angle).
        4. Ensure that the final metadata is visually and structurally consistent with Image 1, accurately representing the floorplan. If confirmed as a duplicate detection, delete the extra instance.
        5. Classify Openings, Use the original floorplan image and the provided opening coordinates to determine whether each opening is a door or a window. Update their labels accordingly. Refer to Image 1 to check if 2 opening position represent the same physical opening. If yes delete it.
        6. Classify Walls, Using the **wall coordinates** and the **segmented image** (which shows wall names at their approximate positions), classify each wall as:
            - **External Wall**: Forms the continuous outer boundary of the floorplan. The boundary **must be closed** (i.e., walls form a sealed perimeter).
            - **Internal Wall**: All walls that are not part of the external boundary.
            - Wall names must remain unchanged.
        7. Order Components. When listing the components (walls, openings, etc.), always start from the top-left of the floorplan and continue in a clockwise direction.
        8. Define Slab Midpoints. For all final external walls, calculate the midpoint of each wall segment using its coordinates [[x1, y1], [x2, y2]]. Return a list of all such midpoints, which define the slab.
