# Vectorworks Wall Tool — Practical Guide  
*Tested in Vectorworks 2025; the same steps apply to 2023-2024 unless noted.*

## 1. Why Use the Wall Tool?  
The Wall tool is the BIM-ready way to draw straight, curved, and curtain walls. It can auto-join to create room-tight networks, carry multi-layer **components**, and bind to story levels so walls flex when floor-to-floor heights change. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 3. Launching the Tool  

### 3-A Quick-start: Drawing Your First Wall  
*(If you’re in a hurry, follow these seven clicks.)*

1. **Activate the Wall tool**  
   *Building Shell ▸ Wall* *(shortcut **9**).*

2. **Move the cursor to your desired start point** in the plan view.  
   A cross-hair cursor and a floating heads-up “L/A” display will appear.

3. **Click once** to drop the **start point**.  
   This fixes the wall’s insertion line at that spot.

4. **Move the cursor in the desired direction until the end point**.  
   As you move, the live length and angle update in the floating data bar.

5. **Click again** to set the **end of the first segment**.  
   - In **Vertex mode** the tool stays live, so you can  
     - **Move** to the next corner and **click** again for a new segment,  
     - …repeat as needed.

6. **Finish the wall chain**  
   - press **Enter** to end the polyline, **or**  
   - Tap **`X` twice** to cancel without drawing.

7. Walls auto-join when their ends touch. If they don’t, run the **Wall Join** tool afterwards.

> **Tip:** While drawing you can press **Tab** to type an exact length or angle, **`Shift`** to lock orthogonal, or **`C`** to toggle a curved segment mid-sequence.

*(This quick-start fits naturally between Section 3 “Launching the Tool” and Section 4 “Drawing Basic Walls” in the full guide.)*

## 5. Understanding Wall Preferences  

> *Double-click* the Wall tool (or press **⌥/Alt** while it’s active).

Key fields:

| Tab | What to set |
|-----|-------------|
| **General** | Thickness (unstyled), Height, Control-line offset |
| **Definition** | *Components*: add layers such as drywall, insulation, brick | :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} |
| **Insertion Options** | Story-level top/bottom bindings |
| **Data** | IFC, Energos, custom records |

Click **Save as Style** if you’d like to reuse the settings.

## 6. Wall Styles in Practice  

### 6.1 Creating or Importing  
1. **Resource Manager ▸ New Resource ▸ Wall Style** or duplicate an existing one.  
2. Edit the *Definition* tab just like a normal wall, then **OK**. The style now lives in your file or library. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

### 6.2 Applying  
- **Before drawing**: choose the style in the Tool Bar or Wall Preferences.  
- **After drawing**: select walls ▸ Object Info Palette ▸ **Replace** or drag-and-drop a style from the Resource Manager. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

### 6.3 Converting  
Object Info Palette ▸ Style ▸ **Convert to Unstyled Wall** to unlock attribute-by-wall editing. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

## 7. Editing Existing Walls  

| Method | Use it for | How |
|--------|------------|-----|
| **Object Info Palette** | Length, height, style swap, caps | Select wall and edit fields. |
| **Edit Wall Tool** | Peaks, vertices, curtain-wall grids | Double-click wall or choose *Building Shell > Edit Wall*. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8} |
| **Reshape Tool** | Stretch ends in plan | Drag control handles. |
| **Delete Wall Peaks** | Remove top/bottom jogs | Modify ▸ Delete Peaks. |

---

## 8. Managing Components  

1. Select wall ▸ **Components** in the Object Info Palette (unstyled) or **Edit Style** (styled).  
2. **New** / **Edit** to set **Name, Thickness, Class, Material**.  
3. Drag the **#** column to reorder; tick **Core** for structural core line. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
4. Use **Eyedropper** to copy component setups between walls.

## 10. Common Shortcut Reference

| **`J`** | Toggle Join/Trim modes while drawing |
| **`C`** in Vertex mode | Switch to curved segment |
