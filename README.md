**BIMgent** is a novel agentic framework that enables architectural building modeling process to be performed autonomously through computer control.

Overview of the BIMgent framework.

occupying most of the floor area. The layout should also include two  
enclosed meeting rooms, a manager‚Äôs office, a small pantry, and two  
restrooms.**

## üîß Setup

### Software
The current version is based on and developed for the BIM authoring tool Vectorworks. When adapting the repository, please ensure you have Vectorworks installed on your PC. A valid license is required for the software applications.

### Prepare API Keys

This project uses APIs from OpenAI and Google (Gemini).  
You will need to update the `.env` file with your own API keys:
```
env OA_OPENAI_KEY="your_openai_api_key" # OpenAI API key 
Gemini_KEY="your_gemini_api_key" # Google Gemini API key 
```


### Dependencies
Please set up your Python (3.10) environment and install the required dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Get Started

Please update the configuration file at `conf/env_config_vectorworks.json` before running the agent:


1. Download Required Models
This framework relies on models developed in other repositories. Please download them and configure the model paths accordingly in the configuration file.

### Download Instructions

#### 1. DeepFloorplan Model
- **Repository**: [DeepFloorplan](https://github.com/zlzeng/DeepFloorplan)
- **Download**: Follow the model download instructions in the repository

#### 2. OmniParser Model
- **Repository**: [OmniParser](https://github.com/microsoft/OmniParser)
- **Download**: Follow the model download instructions in the repository


2. Update `panel_coordinates` to match your tool panel, design panel and object info panel layout.  
   The format is `[x1, y1, x2, y2]` where:
   - `x1, y1` = top-left corner  
   - `x2, y2` = bottom-right corner

   Panel Definitions:
      - **Tool Panel**: Located on the left side, containing the list of interactable tools.
      - **Design Panel**: The central area where users interact to model the building.
      - **Object Info Panel**: Positioned on the right side, displaying information about selected components.

   The detailed coordinates can be obtained by running the following script:

   ```bash
   python mouse_detector.py
   ```
## Run

Use the following command to run the agent:

```bash
python agent_runner.py
```

To view the logic please check the script:
```
runner/vectorworks_runner.py
```
